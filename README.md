Anthony Bolton's FIEA Programming Portfolio Submission

The program "Pong-Breaker-SDL" was programmed using the SDL API and in the
Visual Studio 2010 IDE.  There is the presence of game states called from the
main application using a gamestate stack, with popping and pushing of game
states as necessary.

Additionally, there is a small bit of code exemplifying simple code written using
Open GL 1.0.  It's a gravity demo, where the 'Earth' is at the center of the screen
and two satellites orbit it just based on the force exerted by the 'Earth'.

Overall, the "Pong Breaker SDL" is more exemplary of my coding style/abilities.

Also within this fileshare is the file containing the written interview questions and
answers.

Thank you for your time in considering this portfolio!
